## Short intro

I'm an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Vilnius University, Lithuania. My main area is number theory. However, I also teach CS courses on web development, Java, and Python. I'm interested in Machine learning. For several years in a row, students wrote their Bachelor's thesis on Machine learning under my supervision.
